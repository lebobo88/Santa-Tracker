# RLM Method - Cursor Integration

This project uses the RLM (Research-Lead-Manage) method for AI-assisted development.

## Key Directories
- `RLM/specs/` - All specifications (constitution, features, architecture)
- `RLM/agents/` - Agent prompts defining behavior for different tasks
- `RLM/templates/` - Templates for spec documents
- `RLM/tasks/` - Active and completed tasks
- `RLM/progress/` - Progress tracking and reports

## Discovery Process

When asked to "discover", "research", or start a new project/feature:

1. **Read** `RLM/agents/research-agent.md` for the full process
2. **Research** the idea - analyze competitors, best practices, existing solutions
3. **Questions** - Ask clarifying questions by category:
   - Business (Critical): Goals, users, timeline, success metrics
   - Technical (High): Scale, integrations, tech constraints
   - Data (High): Storage, compliance, privacy requirements
   - Security (Medium): Auth, encryption, audit needs
   - UX (Medium): Platforms, accessibility, user flows
4. **Draft** specs following templates in `RLM/templates/`
5. **Save** to `RLM/specs/`

## Implementation Process

When implementing features:

1. **Read** the feature spec from `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/spec.md`
2. **Follow TDD** - Write tests first, then implement
3. **Check** constitution at `RLM/specs/constitution.md` for standards
4. **Update** progress in `RLM/progress/`

## Spec Locations

- Constitution: `RLM/specs/constitution.md`
- Features: `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/spec.md`
- Architecture: `RLM/specs/architecture/overview.md`
- Epic Breakdown: `RLM/specs/epics/breakdown.md`

## Running Discovery Script

For full automated discovery with web research:
```powershell
./RLM/commands/rlm-discover.ps1 --idea "your project idea"
```

## Standards

- Always reference specs before making changes
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Document public APIs
