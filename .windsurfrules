# RLM Method - Windsurf Integration

This project uses the RLM (Research-Lead-Manage) method for AI-assisted development.

## Spec Locations
- Constitution: `RLM/specs/constitution.md` - Project standards
- Features: `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/spec.md` - Feature specifications
- Architecture: `RLM/specs/architecture/` - Technical decisions
- Tasks: `RLM/tasks/active/` - Current work items

## Agent Prompts
- Research: `RLM/agents/research-agent.md` - Discovery process
- Architecture: `RLM/agents/master-architect.md` - Design decisions
- Implementation: `RLM/agents/implementation-agent.md` - Coding standards
- Testing: `RLM/agents/testing-agent.md` - Test strategy

## Discovery Command

When asked to "discover" or "research" a new idea:

1. Read `RLM/agents/research-agent.md` for the process
2. Research: Analyze idea, competitors, best practices
3. Questions: Ask clarifying questions by category
   - Business (goals, users, timeline)
   - Technical (scale, integrations, constraints)
   - Data (storage, compliance, privacy)
   - Security (auth, encryption, audit)
   - UX (platforms, accessibility)
4. Draft specs following `RLM/templates/`
5. Save to `RLM/specs/`

## Implementation Standards

- Always read the feature spec before implementing
- Follow TDD - write tests first
- Check constitution for coding standards
- Reference specs in commits (e.g., "Implements FTR-001")
- Update progress in `RLM/progress/`

## Running Discovery Script

```powershell
./RLM/commands/rlm-discover.ps1 --idea "your project idea"
./RLM/commands/rlm-discover.ps1 --idea "idea" --provider openai --model gpt-4o
```
