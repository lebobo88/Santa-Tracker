# Prime Task Context

Load context for working on a specific task.

## Instructions

1. Read the task file at `RLM/tasks/active/{{TASK_ID}}.md`
2. Read the parent feature spec
3. Check task dependencies and their status
4. List files to be modified

## Context to Load

### Required Files
- `RLM/tasks/active/{{TASK_ID}}.md`
- `RLM/specs/constitution.md`

### From Task File
- Parent feature spec: `RLM/specs/features/FTR-XXX/spec.md`
- Dependency tasks (check their status)
- Files to modify/create

## Output Format

```markdown
## Task Context: {{TASK_ID}}

## Next Steps

After loading context:
1. Start TDD with `/rlm-implement {{TASK_ID}}`
2. Write failing test first
3. Implement minimal code
4. Refactor
5. Verify all tests pass
